through his brain or through his years or through his heart or the blood that ran through his veins or his pleasure and pain I saw the Hudson and imagined that maybe the house had remained\r\n\r\njust as it was until Lou's last days\r\nwe were there and for 3 or 4 hours and it was so unreal that I forgot my name\r\nand Laurie gave me a hug it felt like a dream\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not the kind of guy who would reveal the details of what caught my eye\r\nat their house to random girls and guys\r\nwith the exception of a birthday gift given to him by Muhammad Ali  \r\nthat was framed and in that moment I was frozen and  it was just i and me\r\nuninterrupted and I thought oh my god\r\nwhat 2 powerful independent minds \r\nif the two of them conversed\r\nit would probably be the greatest conversation ever in the history of the universe \r\n\r\nI thought what two strong brave individual minds\r\nand I am nothing but a speck of sand on the beach but so am I \r\nif you don't like this song or what i have to say then\r\nfuck off and listen to Bye Bye Miss American Pie\r\nbecause it's from my heart and so is this next line\r\n\r\ni'm a black sheep baby and I'll eat you alive\r\nand I'm kind and gentle and I'm good listener and I can read people's eyes\r\nand I'm fun to be around and I'm endearing and can sing songs that make grown men cry\r\nand if you're down and out i'm not the type to tense up so spill it baby don't be shy\r\n\r\nCaroline and Laurie shared a love of Rat Terriers\r\nbut I walked to the Muhammad Ali framed photo and I stared at it\r\nat least a few times for it was all too much as Ali had recently died\r\nand I couldn't help thinking all of our time will come\r\nyou you  you and you and you too and I\r\n\r\n\r\ntonight I walked around New York all on my own\r\nbetween Broadway and 5th and 28th and 34th\r\nI've always loved 32nd street Korean way \r\nthe women's bodies around there are curvy and wrapped beautifully \r\nthey look like walking decorative  vases \r\nand all the wonderful tastes of Bulgogi and Kalbi\r\nand the sexy red soup with bean curd and the spicy Kimchi\r\nand Madison Square Garden and Joe Louis Plaza\r\nand Jack's Dempsey's  and Macy's and I'm sentimental about\r\nmany things in this 6 by 2 by block radius\r\n\r\nbut tonight Lou was still on my mind he had a stunning view of the water as do I\r\nback in San Francisco I look at small distant cities and I watch the boats pass\r\nit was less than three years ago that I walked on stage in London just as I heard that Lou had died\r\nI played Caroline Says and The Kids and I talked for a bit and I wanted to cry\r\n'cause at the Vancouver Olympics I had briefly met Lou\r\nand what his album Berlin meant to me I'm not even gonna to try to explain it to you\r\n\r\nthis year has been a  strange motherfucker\r\npeople gettin' killed in America and France and two 12 year old girls\r\nare being tried as adults for attempted murder\r\nwhere was their father where was their mother while they were bein'\r\nbrain washed by Slenderman, brother?\r\nand Trump is all over the TV\r\nLet's face it we asked for this fuck  because we've been surpassed by technology\r\nwe've have our head sup our asses sending selfies around the planet\r\nand  getting'  run over by cars while we jerk off to Pokeman mon\r\nso here's this motherfucker spouting off and if you think you took\r\nno part in his place in this world\r\nthen you're fired  because you've not been paying attention and your apprenticeship expired\r\n\r\nI've digressed but I keep following my path that lead me from first hearing Berlin when I was 19\r\nto The Power Of The Heart\r\nwhere at Lou's tribute concert I sung and I was honored to have taken part\r\nand the night was magical and humid and dark \r\nLaurie looked for sun Lou looked for rain well she had sun that day and at night Lou had his rain\r\nand I did what I came here to do and shared the Lincoln Center stage\r\nwith all of that talent and those amazing singers\r\nand all of those original brains\r\n\r\n\r\nand tonight from 32nd I hear siren's creepin' up and trailin' off\r\nand as a walked I saw Sbarro's and thought of my very first trip to New York\r\n1992 all i could afford was Pizza and Dunkin Donuts and I had 20 bucks\r\nleft over that I spent on  a stripper behind a window who reached down and jerked me off\r\nI had a cassette Walkman back then and knew a girl who lived in The Bronx\r\n\r\nwe went out one night and saw a movie Glenn Gary Glenn Ross\r\nI remembered that just now in this humidity as I turn and I toss\r\nthinkin' about Lou and the beautiful things he had not what he had lost\r\nfriends and poetry the love of his life and his beautiful house\r\n\r\nand I'm gonna go to sleep now as in this moment there's nothin' more to write \r\nthank you Laurie I'm forever grateful for that night\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMusic by Justin Broadrick/Words by Mark Kozelek \r\nGod Forbid Publishing BMI/Mute

While that’s nothing new in politics, what is newly alarming in context of the current presidential campaign, is how seemingly effective that strategy has been for a certain candidate. That candidate used the low-hanging fruit of fearmongering to gain his initial momentum and continues to employ variations of it to sustain his place. The only way to steel yourself against that kind of manipulation is to do the real self-work in discovering and letting go of your own fears. While that pursuit is difficult because it means fighting against your own ego, it remains worth the effort—not just for what it can do for us as individuals but even more for what it can do for our collective society. Are you willing to accept that maybe, just possibly, what you feel as a threat, isn’t?
