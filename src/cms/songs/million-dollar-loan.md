quote: >-
  _SEAN HANNITY_ is mid-interview with presidential hopeful, _DONALD J. TRUMP_
  on FOX News.


  SEAN HANNITY:  Now Donald, have you heard the new song written about you by
  the indie rock band, Death Cab For Cutie?


  DONALD TRUMP:  I haven't but I hear it's terrible.  Just a terrible, terrible
  song.  Nobody I know has ever heard of these guys because they have no
  talent.  Absolutely no talent.  Small potatoes if you ask me.  And that band
  name? What a bunch of losers. Bad!


  SH: The singer sounds like a lady but he's actually a 40 year old man!


  DT: Well like I said I haven't heard it but you know, it's terrible.  Everyone
  is saying this.
lyrics: |-
  From a great height he's looking down on his city at night
  From gilded room of gold, marble and soft perfume
  And he's proud to say he built his fortune the old-fashioned way
  Because to succeed there's only one thing you really need

  A million dollar loan
  Nobody makes it on their own without
  A million dollar loan
  You'll reap what you've sown from
  A million dollar loan
  Call your father on the phone and get that 
  Million dollar loan

  His enemies can't contain the flames of jealousy
  With brutish charm the women flock to be on his arm
  Because it's a sign of weakness to apologize 
  And he counter sues from any corner he's backed into

  A million dollar loan
  Nobody makes it on their own without
  A million dollar loan
  To cast the first stone you'll need 
  A million dollar loan
  Every ascension to a throne starts with 
  A million dollar loan

  A million dollar loan
  Nobody makes it on their own without
  A million dollar loan
  You'll reap what you've sown from
  A million dollar loan
  Call your father on the phone and get that 
  Million dollar loan

  A siren screams through the city as he falls asleep
  The campaign begins again at the break of day 

  A million dollar loan
  Nobody makes it on their own without
  A million dollar loan
  To cast the first stone you'll need 
  A million dollar loan
  Every ascension to a throne starts with 
  A million dollar loan

  A million dollar loan
  Nobody makes it on their own without
  A million dollar loan
  You'll reap what you've sown from
  A million dollar loan
  Call your father on the phone and get that 
  Million dollar loan
